Welcome to Kann's Youtube Downloader

This is nothign special, its a simple youtube playlist downlaoding script written in python.
this is my first project in python and i am actively updating it and learning new skills
along the way, i hope to eventually iron out all the bugs and move on to bigger and better
projects soon, thank you for stopping by,

this script takes use of pytube, it was written in replit because i usually work on this in my 
free time at school on a school chromebook.

also this script can be ran on mobile devices through turmux (as long as you have root) OR
(Created a sym link enabling you to move the playlist files from the scripts directory and move
them to your desired songs directory.
